# Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

Many of our local development environments use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to control [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)-based VMs. 

For the most part, we've pooled all of these environments together in to our [Vagrant Infrastructure](https://github.com/OULibraries/vagrant_infrastructure) project, which has information on our recommended versions and setup.
