# Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

Many of our local development environments use Vagrant to control VirtualBox-based VMs. 

## VirtualBox

Download and install the latest VirtualBox Platform Pack and
VirtualBox Extension Pack from https://www.virtualbox.org.

## Vagrant

Download and install https://www.vagrantup.com/

Windows 10 users may run in to [this bug](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/6852)
and need to [install some additional libraries](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328)
to get vagrant working.
